# Installation/Use
PlanetCalc is very easy to use. Simply load the .mlx file in MATLAB and click run. The program will ask you to choose a planet from a pop up window and will also ask you if you'd like to save your data to your desktop. 

The log file will be created in whatever folder your MATLAB is currently indexed into but you can also choose to save it to the desktop to find it more easily. 

NOTE: You will need to install the Aero Toolbox in order for the functions to work correctly. It will prompt you to download it if you don't have it downloaded and try to run the code - just follow the prompts.
